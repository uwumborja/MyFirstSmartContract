installation of MetaMask extension:
I Visited MetaMask website at https://metamask.io/.
Clicked on the "Download" button on the website.
Chose Chrome as my browser.
Followed the prompts to add MetaMask to my browser.
Then I imported an existing wallet.
Within MetaMask, I switched to Sepolia (test network)

Using Remix IDE:
I also visited the official Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
Once the website was loaded, I was able to use the Remix IDE directly in my web browser.
Inside the remix iDE, I Created a new file with a .sol extension (SimpleStorage.sol).
I Used Solidity syntax to define my contract's variables, functions, and modifiers.

compiling:
Remix development environments has built-in compilers.
I used 'pragma solidity ^0.8.28' compiler. 
The compiler will highlight any syntax errors or potential issues in the code.

Deploying the Smart Contract:
Connect to a Blockchain: Choose a network (e.g Ropsten Testnet) and connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask).
Use the deployment feature in the IDE. This will send a transaction to the blockchain to create the contract on the network.
Once deployed, you'll receive the  contract's address, which can be used to interact with it.

Connecting Remix to GitHub  is the major challenge I faced
But I was able to solve it using Gemini AI and also watching some video tutorials on YouTube
I also consulted some experts who gave me guidelines.
